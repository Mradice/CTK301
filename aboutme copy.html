<p class="p1">I am currently a sophomore at Illinois state university and a creative technology major. I would describe myself as creative, hardworking and always looking for fun challenges that can help me through my future. Some of my favorite past time activities are traveling, painting, drawing, and playing sports. I also love animals and currently have a cat named Mango living with me. Although my major is creative technologies after college, I want to do freelance graphic design work along with web page design work In Chicago until I can hopefully find a full-time job and settle down.</p>
