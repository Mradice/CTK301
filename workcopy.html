<p class="depth2">My prompt for this assignment was depth. I decided to make geometric shapes go to a distant vanashing point with steps leading to this vanishing point. I intended for the door at the vanishing point to be an escape from this void and the silhouettes live in this area until they decide to attempt an escape. I used pencils and graphite to create this.</p>

I used acrylic paints on canvas paper to make this.  </p>
