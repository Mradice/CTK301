<p class="okay"> For this project i was assigned to make a abstract self portrait using only a four color palet. I also used a grid which i used to distort my face and break down the shades of color on my face to translate them into one of my four colors I was using. I used acrylic paints on canvas paper to make this.  </p>

<p class="p2">My prompt for this assignment was depth. I decided to make geometric shapes go to a distant vanashing point with steps leading to this vanishing point. I intended for the door at the vanishing point to be an escape from this void and the silhouettes live in this area until they decide to attempt an escape. I used pencils and graphite to create this.</p>

<p class="p3">For this painting I was assignment to create 6 shapes that each demonstrated a mass and a void. I also used a six color pallet and attempted to keep hues and values all different from each other color. I used acrylic paints on canvas paper to make this.</p>

<p class="p4">For this project I was assigned to create a still life on black paper using only white chalk/sketching crayon. I used a vase, bottle, and a triangle and set up two different lights to get a interesting light effect on each object.</p>

<p class="p5">I was assigned to create a still life using only one plant that could either be from outside or a plant I had inside my house. I chose to use a potted plant that I was gifted and tried to show off the long twirling stalk that the plant had. I used pencil and graphite on paper for this.</p>

<p class="p6">My assignment for this project was to create a animal hybrid. The animals I decided to combine were a capybara and a eagle. The main reason that I chose to combine these animals was because I wanted to create the oddest flying creature I could think of. I used markers and pens to create this. </p>

<p class="p7"> All of these works are different sketchbook assignments that I was assigned to make throughout one semester. The prompts for the assignments varied from 3 point perspective to fabric sketches and were all done on paper with sketching pencils. </p>
